i have my timespan for a specific reason so it has to be in that format. i'm trying to add an hour on to the current time. here is what i got, which does not work:

timespan time1= timespan.fromhours(1); // my attempt to add 2 hours
timespan ts = datetime.now.timeofday;
ts.add(time1);
messagebox.show(ts.tostring()); // for showing me its result


can you please advise?
